            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York to a Jewish family, I am 
            a former highschool drop-out that acquired my GED to pursue a better 
            career. After working various low-level jobs, I decided to seek out more 
            fulfilling employment and after a couple years of working for startups 
            in marketing roles (among other small roles) I am currently working towards
            a career in software engineering.
